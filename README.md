# Ticket to Ride Pathfinder
This finds an estimate of the shortest path to connect a given set of tickets.  

To add ticket, start the main.py file to open the main window and click on "Place Picker".
Then type as many tickets as you want to be a part of the route.
After, go back to the main window and click "Route Map" to see a display of the estimated shortest route calculated and how many trains it requires.  

This has not been thoroughly bug-tested yet so there may be some errors. I will attempt to fix them later.
